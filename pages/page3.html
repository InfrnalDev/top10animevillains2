        <h1>The Top 10 Anime Villains Of All Time (Page 3)</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Kid Buu</h3></li>
                    <img src="../images/kidbuu.jpg">
                <p>Buu's only reason for existence was to cause absolute 
                    destruction. He enjoyed the destruction he brought 
                    to the universe, and sought destruction purely for 
                    entertainments sake.

                        Kid Buu
                    </a>                  
                </p>
                <li><h3>DIO</h3></li>
                    <img src="../images/dio.jpg">
                <p>What cant be said abou the all powerful DIO. Able to withstand 
                    time itself due to a vampiric infection the mighty DIO lives 
                    only for hatred of all those in those within the Joestar
                    family.

                <li><h3>Light Yagami</h3></li>
                    <img src="../images/lightyagami.jpg">
                <p>If one were to search up the definition of "God 
                    complex" our dear friend Light Yagami would find 
                    himself the picture perfect representative. Light 
                    AKA Kira has taken it upon himself to purge the world of 
                    evil through the use of his Death Note, but who is truly 
                    the evil in the world.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Pain</h3></li>
                    <img src="../images/pain.jpg">
                <p>Born of the pain of war. His goal was to cleasne the world 
                    of pain.. through inflicting pain. His twisted methodology 
                    showing the mental scars warfare had taken on the children 
                    of the battle ravaged warlands.
